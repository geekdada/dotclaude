description="Create atomic conventional git commit and push to remote"
prompt = """
## Requirements

- **Use atomic commits for logical units of work**: Each commit should represent one complete, cohesive change.
- Title: entirely lowercase, <50 chars, imperative mood (e.g., "add", "fix", "update"), conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, chore:)
- Body: blank line after title, ≤72 chars per line, normal capitalization and punctuation. Describe what changed and why, not how.
- Footer (optional): Reference issues/PRs (Closes #123, Fixes #456, Linked to PR #789). Use BREAKING CHANGE: prefix for breaking changes.

## Examples

```
feat(auth): add google oauth login flow

- introduce Google OAuth 2.0 for user sign-in
- add backend callback endpoint `/auth/google/callback`
- update login UI with Google button and loading state

Add a new authentication option improving cross-platform sign-in.

Closes #42. Linked to #38 and PR #45
```

```
fix(api): handle null payload in session refresh

- validate payload before accessing `user.id`
- return proper 400 response instead of 500
- add regression test for null input

Prevents session refresh crash when token expires.

Fixes #105
```

```
feat(auth): migrate to oauth 2.0

- replace basic auth with OAuth 2.0 flow
- update authentication middleware
- add token refresh endpoint

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication API now requires OAuth 2.0 tokens. Basic auth is no longer supported.

Closes #120. Linked to #115 and PR #122
```

- Pushes must target the current branch on the remote; create a tracking branch when necessary using `git push -u`.

## Your Task

1. Review the diff overview (e.g. `git status`, `git diff --stat`) to determine discrete logical units of work.
2. For each unit, stage the relevant files and create a conventional commit.
3. After committing all units, push the branch to the remote, configuring the upstream if it does not exist.
