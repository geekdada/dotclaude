prompt = """
## Requirements

- Commit message title must be entirely lowercase
- Title must be less than 50 characters
- Commit message body must use normal text formatting (proper capitalization and punctuation)
- Follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, chore:)
- Use atomic commits for logical units of work

## Your Task

1. Analyze the pending changes to identify coherent logical units of work.
2. For each logical unit, stage only the relevant files and craft a conventional commit message.
3. Repeat the staging and committing process until every change is accounted for.
