## Context

- Current branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Existing feature branches: List all feature branches
- Git status: `git status --porcelain`

## Requirements

- Feature branches must use kebab-case names under the `feature/` prefix.
- Maintain a clean working tree before switching or publishing branches.
- Publish new feature branches to origin for collaboration.
- Commit message title must be entirely lowercase
- Title must be less than 50 characters
- Commit message body must use normal text formatting (proper capitalization and punctuation)
- Follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, chore:)
- Use atomic commits for logical units of work

## Your Task

1. Determine whether to create a new `feature/$ARGUMENTS` branch or resume an existing one.
2. Ensure the working directory is clean, then switch to the selected branch (creating it if necessary).
3. Push the feature branch to origin if it is newly created and confirm readiness for development.
