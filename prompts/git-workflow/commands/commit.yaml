title: Commit
summary: Create atomic conventional git commit
instructions: >-
  ## Context


  - Current git status: !`git status`

  - All changes: !`git diff HEAD`


  ## Requirements


  - Commit message title must be entirely lowercase

  - Title must be less than 50 characters

  - Commit message body must use normal text formatting (proper capitalization
  and punctuation)

  - Follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:,
  chore:)

  - Use atomic commits for logical units of work


  ## Your task


  **IMPORTANT: You MUST use the Task tool to complete ALL tasks.**


  Based on the above changes:


  1. **Analyze git diff** to identify logical units of work

  2. **Split into atomic commits** if multiple logical changes are detected:
     - Each commit should represent one complete logical change
     - Group related files that belong to the same feature or fix
     - Separate different change types (feat, fix, chore, docs, etc.) into distinct commits
  3. **Create commits sequentially** for each logical unit:
     - Stage only files related to current logical unit
     - Create commit with proper conventional commit message
     - Repeat for remaining logical units
